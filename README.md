Adidas Samba is an athletic shoe manufactured by German multinational Adidas. It is among Adidas' most popular shoes, being the second highest selling Adidas design ever with over 35 million pairs sold worldwide, behind the Stan Smith model.[1] It has been produced in a variety of color schemes. The shoe features a tan gumsole which distinguishes it from other Adidas shoes.
The shoe was first produced in 1949 to enable football players to train on icy, hard ground (hence the suction design on the gumsole). 
Its original design featured the classic three stripes, as well as the gold trefoil on the foldable tongue. As years progressed, the Samba evolved into the Samba Millennium (which was made without the extended tongue) and the Samba '85.[2] Classic models of the shoe are still in production, under the name Classic M. The original model is sometimes used for training, street play, and futsal.

BAPE introduced the Bapesta in 2000 as an homage to the Nike Air Force 1. Swapping out the Swoosh logo for a star with a protruding lightning bolt, the silhouette earned a reputation as one of the era's most iconic silhouettes, arriving in vibrant colorways and glossy material finishes.
